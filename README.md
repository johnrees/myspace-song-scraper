Dependencies
------------

To use this you will need the following libraries

* [rtmpdump](http://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu/)
* [ffmpeg](http://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)

For Mac users it's easiest to install with either MacPorts or the newer, awesome, [Homebrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew)

Too much to list right now!


Addendum
--------

On the server it also uses a cronjob and background daemons to enqueue the archives and purge them after an hour of inactivity
