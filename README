# Dependencies
To use this you will need the following libraries
* [rtmpdump](http://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu/)
* [ffmpeg](http://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)
For Mac users I'd recommend installing with either MacPorts or the newer, awesome, [Homebrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew)

# Notes
I currently use a cronjob and background daemons to enqueue the archives and purge them after an hour on the server
